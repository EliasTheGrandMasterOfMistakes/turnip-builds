# Unofficial Mesa3D Freedreno's Turnip CI releases

  This is a unofficial CI releases for Turnip Vulkan Driver from Mesa3D to Magisk and Adrenotools targets

## What is Turnip?

 Turnip is a open source vulkan driver from freedreno project: https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/freedreno/freedreno. Developed first think in linux and chromeos usage.
 Turnip is based on reverse engineering backed in past from Google help and now maintained with @igalia help with Open Source Mesa3D community.
 Turnip leverage all power from Mesa3D common code libraries, Queue common code, WSI, Mesa Vulkan Runtime and NIR compiler library and Intermediate Representation.

 Mesa3D as default support multiple platforms in common code, this include Android Platform. Turnip to be supported in Android
 that is a different platform needs to use KGSL that is a Kernel Driver Qualcoom Layer for Adreno GPUs.

## Why Turnip is better for emulators or Termux Games usage?

  Different from Qualcomm Proprietary Drivers that targets Android, Turnip reaches Linux and Chromeos in Mind, this means
  that is trying to expose all necessary capabilities that a Linux Desktop or Linux Mobile environment depends to use. 
  By leverage Mesa3D common code and community contribuitions, Turnip can implement and in some cases that is in commom Mesa3D
  code, gains and expose multiples capabilities and extensions at is necessary for run emulators that can be not optimized to use
  limited Vulkan Android support or can gains performance when some specific extensions out of android usage and that is not obrigatory.
  in termux cases this is like a Linux Desktop, and you can gains a better compatibility.

  Qualcomm proprietary driver doesn't depend to target specific Linux and is not obrigatory to use extensions that is out of android apps usage
  and in majority of cases not expose a greater Vulkan version than 1.1 or 1.2 target depending of which Adreno GPU are in device.

  For default Turnip exposes Vulkan 1.3 version.

## GPU Compatibility:
  
  Turnip is just supported in Adreno 6xx and 7xx GPUs, Adreno 5xx and below is not supported.
  Turnip can be not supported in specific Adreno variants because of lack of support.

## More information:

### Magisk Usage:

  This is designed to be used like a Magisk Module, if you reach problems just disable if are necessary.

### Out of Magisk (Non-Root) Targets:

 Is possible to install out of magisk or root devices, you will need to be in permissive rom
 and using extract vulkan.adreno.so library, You can use ADB pull or acess using Adb shell, TWRP File manager is possible too.

 Folder Location: Vendor/lib64/hw/

### Vendor 32 Libraries:
 Doesn't exist for while a 32 bits library, i recommend you to use a just 64bit rom or not use a 32 bit application if are possible

### Adreno Tools:
  We now build in CI adrenotools releases for usage in emulators
  it's based in a copy from [adrenotoolsdrivers](https://github.com/K11MCH1/AdrenoToolsDrivers) from KIMCHI
  You can use in supported emulators
  
### Scheduled Releases:
- Automated releases at 06:00 UTC on the 1st and 15th of each month.

### Notes:
- Root must be visible to target app/game.
- Tested with these apps/games listed [here](list.md).

### To Build Locally:
- Obtain the script [turnip_builder.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ilhan-athn7/freedreno_turnip-CI/main/turnip_builder.sh) on your linux environment. (visit the link and use ```CTRL + S``` keys)
- Execute script on linux terminal ```bash ./turnip_builder.sh```
- To build experimental branchs, change [this](https://github.com/ilhan-athn7/freedreno_turnip-CI/blob/c704685653879114860ce4cae9629a2511c6eeea/turnip_builder.sh#L50) line, and add one more line to rename unzipped folder to mesa-main.
